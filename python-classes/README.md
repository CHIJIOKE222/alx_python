Python Classes
A class is considered as a blueprint of objects. We can think of the class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object.

Since many houses can be made from the same description, we can create many objects from a class.

Define Python Class
We use the class keyword to create a class in Python. For example,

class ClassName:
    # class definition 
Here, we have created a class named ClassName.

Let's see an example,

class Bike:
    name = ""
    gear = 0
Here,

Bike - the name of the class
name/gear - variables inside the class with default values "" and 0 respectively.
Note: The variables inside a class are called attributes.
